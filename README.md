## Special Mention

This is a React based personal resume website. The project was forked and edited from [Tim Baker](https://github.com/tbakerx)'s [Template](https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template) and is built with typescript on the Next.js framework, styled with Tailwind css and hosted on Vercel. Drop him a star if you like the website!
